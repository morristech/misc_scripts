A collection of random scripts I've written for whatever reason
I'll add to it, bit by bit.

Linesc.sh is a fairly terrible enumeration script I wrote for Linux.

upxbreak.sh takes a UPX'd binary and swaps the UPX! marker with a randomly generated alpha-numeric string

sshscan uses ifconfig, ssh-keyscan and seq to enumerate boxes with SSHds on a local network (well, first network with a broadcast address); good if you don't have a port-scanner, and reasonably fast. Pulls version and keys, too.
